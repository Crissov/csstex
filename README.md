# CSSTeX
CSSTeX develops, collects, harmonizes, documents and publishes CSS files that recreate the stylistic features of popular TeX and LaTeX document classes or packages for use with HTML, TEXML or other markup languages supported by Selectors 3.

The intended use is easy and reliable creation of high quality prints and ebooks from web sources. In many cases, this will likely happen with dedicated tools, such as Antenna House Formatter and Prince XML, rather than with common web browsers. The target audience are authors and developers familiar with (La)TeX, but dissatisfied with its cross-media capabilities.

You are very welcome to participate. We need to decide which (La)TeX styles we want to support first, research their characteristics, convert them to CSS accompanied by sample HTML documents, test and refine, repeat.

This project was previously hosted at Google Code.
