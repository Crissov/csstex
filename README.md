# CSSTeX
CSSTeX develops, collects, harmonizes, documents and publishes CSS files that recreate the stylistic features of popular TeX and LaTeX document classes or packages for use with HTML, [TEXML] or other markup languages supported by Selectors 3. 
[LaTeXML] is a more complex project that covers similar goals, but itâ€™s main objective is to develop a TeX parser written in Perl that outputs XML.
[PubCSS] is not concerned with (La)TeX per se, but offers independent HTML+CSS solutions for some scientific document styles.

The intended use is easy and reliable creation of high quality prints and ebooks from web sources. In many cases, this will likely happen with dedicated tools, such as [Weasy Print][weasy], [Antenna House Formatter][AHF] and [Prince XML][prince], rather than with common web browsers. The target audience are authors and developers familiar with (La)TeX, but dissatisfied with its cross-media capabilities.

You are very welcome to participate. We need to decide which (La)TeX styles we want to support first, research their characteristics, convert them to CSS accompanied by sample HTML documents, test and refine, repeat.
